\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a solution for 
producing quality scores for physical establishments such as 
restaurants and bars.
This score can be used to order places, improving the performance
of applications such as recommendation engines and local search.
By using machine learning techniques to train a model on trusted
editorial reviews and social media data,
the model can accurately predict the expected editorial score
in the absense of an official score.
\emph{SolocoRank} inherently leverages a variety of different data sources
and does not rely on any one particular form of user-generated data.
\emph{SolocoRank} can easily be later adapted to other forms of data,
as users evolve the way they provide feedback on restaurants.
Many opportunities exist to improve on our existing work,
such as producing localized classifiers for each city,
or using other forms of feature encoding and data sources.
Overall, our techniques help unveil important information
that gives web services a unique ability to judge establishments
for improved user recommendations on websites.
